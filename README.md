# thesis checklist

an interactive checklist for the things i have to do in my thesis revision period.

was born purely out of the insatiable craving for procrastination and my strong dislike
of the thesis work itself.

uses google cloud firestore to have data persistency.

has a simple authorization system set up so that  visitors can only see the data
and manipulate it temporarily, but only i can manipulate data permanently.

everything (css, js) is in one html file because initially i was only playing and
procrastinating. and then i thought it'd be a kind of silly challenge to keep everything
in just one file (no npm, no react, not even a file structure) but still add multiple
functionalities and database and stuff.
